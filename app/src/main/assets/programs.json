The course introduces students to the steps required to install and configure a database server and development system. Then, it expands the students’ knowledge of SQL by introducing more complex syntax than that covered in the first database course. Topics covered include advanced SQL queries, PLSQL, advanced data and table manipulation commands, basic security, triggers, functions, procedures, and packages, NoSQL document management, CRUD operations and data queries, indexing and aggregation techniques. The course will include a project to develop the database back-end for a “commercial” web application."
